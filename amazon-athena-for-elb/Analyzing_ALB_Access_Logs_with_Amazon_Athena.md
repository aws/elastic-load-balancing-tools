# Analyzing ALB Access Logs with Amazon Athena
This document includes an overview of setting up Amazon Athena and table creation for Elastic Load Balancing log analysis.

> For a CDK & CloudFormation sample that deploys this solution: https://github.com/aws/elastic-load-balancing-tools/blob/master/log-analysis-elb-cdk-cf-template

Setup steps:
1. Setup AWS account, ELB + enable access logs
2. Configure your S3 bucket for Athena access
3. Setup your new database and table refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/application-load-balancer-logs.html#create-alb-table for the latest query to create the table
```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS alb_logs (
    type string,
    time string,
    elb string,
    client_ip string,
    client_port int,
    target_ip string,
    target_port int,
    request_processing_time double,
    target_processing_time double,
    response_processing_time double,
    elb_status_code string,
    target_status_code string,
    received_bytes bigint,
    sent_bytes bigint,
    request_verb string,
    request_url string,
    request_proto string,
    user_agent string,
    ssl_cipher string,
    ssl_protocol string,
    target_group_arn string,
    trace_id string,
    domain_name string,
    chosen_cert_arn string,
    matched_rule_priority string,
    request_creation_time string,
    actions_executed string,
    redirect_url string,
    error_reason string,
    new_field string,
    classification string,
    classification_reason string
    )
    ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.RegexSerDe'
    WITH SERDEPROPERTIES (
    'serialization.format' = '1',
    'input.regex' = 
'([^ ]*) ([^ ]*) ([^ ]*) ([^ ]*):([0-9]*) ([^ ]*)[:-]([0-9]*) ([-.0-9]*) ([-.0-9]*) ([-.0-9]*) (|[-0-9]*) (-|[-0-9]*) ([-0-9]*) ([-0-9]*) \"([^ ]*) ([^ ]*) (- |[^ ]*)\" \"([^\"]*)\" ([A-Z0-9-]+) ([A-Za-z0-9.-]*) ([^ ]*) \"([^\"]*)\" \"([^\"]*)\" \"([^\"]*)\" ([-.0-9]*) ([^ ]*) \"([^\"]*)\" \"([^\"]*)\"($| \"[^ ]*\")(.*)')
    LOCATION 's3://your-alb-logs-directory/AWSLogs/<ACCOUNT-ID>/elasticloadbalancing/region';
```
4. Run queries
### Select data information for time period
```sql
    SELECT client_ip,
         count(client_ip) AS requestCount,
         avg(received_bytes+sent_bytes) AS avgTransactionSize,
         sum(received_bytes+sent_bytes) AS totalBytes
    FROM alb_logs
    WHERE time > '2018-11-01'
            AND time < '2018-11-29'
    GROUP BY  client_ip
    ORDER BY  requestCount DESC limit 10;
```
### View total data processed for time period
```sql
    SELECT count(client_ip) AS totalRequestCount,
         avg(received_bytes+sent_bytes) AS avgTransactionSize,
         sum(received_bytes+sent_bytes) AS totalBytes
    FROM alb_logs
    WHERE time > '2018-11-29'
            AND time < '2018-12-01';
```
### Select request IPs
```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT client_ip
    FROM alb_logs limit 100;
```
### Get top 100 clients by request count
```sql
    SELECT client_ip,
         count(client_ip) AS ct
    FROM alb_logs
    GROUP BY  client_ip
    ORDER BY  ct DESC limit 100;
```
#### plus response+request size
```sql
    SELECT client_ip,
         count(client_ip) AS requestCount,
         avg(received_bytes+sent_bytes) AS avgTransactionSize
    FROM alb_logs
    GROUP BY  client_ip
    ORDER BY  requestCount DESC limit 100;
```
### Ciphers by use
```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT ssl_cipher,
         count(ssl_cipher) AS cipherCount
    FROM alb_logs
    GROUP BY  ssl_cipher limit 100;
```
### Last 30 Day Ciphers and TLS Version by use
```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT ssl_cipher AS TLSCipher,
         ssl_protocol AS TLSVersion,
         count(ssl_cipher) AS TLSCipherCount
    FROM alb_logs
    WHERE from_iso8601_timestamp(time) > current_timestamp - interval '30' day
        AND NOT ssl_protocol = '-'
    GROUP BY  ssl_cipher,ssl_protocol
    ORDER BY  TLSCipherCount DESC
```
### Top 100 backends
```sql
    SELECT target_ip AS backend,
         count(target_ip) AS count,
         avg(received_bytes)+avg(sent_bytes) AS avgTransactionSize
    FROM alb_logs
    GROUP BY  target_ip
    ORDER BY  count DESC limit 100;
```
### Summary of ELB
```sql
    SELECT count(1) AS requests,
         count(1)/date_diff('second',date_parse(min(time),'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%i:%s.%fZ'),date_parse(max(time),'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%i:%s.%fZ')) AS requestPerSecond,avg(received_bytes + sent_bytes) AS avg_requestSize_bytes, min(time) AS startTime, max(time) AS endTime
    FROM alb_logs;
```
### Summary of Non-Compliant HTTP Requests
```sql
    SELECT COUNT(1) AS requests,
     request_verb,
     classification,
     classification_reason
    FROM alb_logs
    GROUP BY request_verb, classification, classification_reason
    LIMIT 100;
```
